# Frontend Coding Test - Country List App

## Instructions

Your task is to develop a country list app using React. The requirements are as follows:

1. Create two screens: a list view and a card view.
2. Integrate with a GET API (https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all) to retrieve country data.
3. Populate the list view and card view with the country data.
4. Implement the ability to toggle between the list view and card view.
5. Implement a search functionality for users to search for a country using an input field.
6. Implement a filter functionality for users to filter countries by region.
7. Provide a separate page to display more detailed information when a country is clicked.
8. Ensure the website is responsive and works well on both laptops and mobile devices.
9. Implement a color scheme toggle between light and dark mode.

You are allowed to use any React-compatible framework or library to assist in your development process, such as Next.js, Vite, Tailwind, Material UI, Axios, etc.

You are also required to create a README file (README.md) and include it in the code repository. The README should provide a brief explanation of your code structure, as well as any libraries or packages used in the development process.

The attached images are provided for reference purposes only. You have complete freedom to develop your own design and be as creative as you desire.

You are given 1 week to complete this test.

## Deployment & Submission

1. Upload your code to a Github repository and make it public.
2. Deploy your app to a free static hosting website such as Github pages, Vercel, Netlify, etc.
3. Send us the Github repository URL and the live site URL via email.
